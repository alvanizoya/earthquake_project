However, as you all know, Japan often has earthquakes, and that's what I'm really scared of. Therefore, as a graduation project for this course, I will investigate Japanese earthquake data in the past and will show it on a map so that when we look at it we will know the locality which is good.\n\n### Business Problem \nThe problem here will be: \n**Based on the earthquake data in the past, can we know where the earthquake occurs frequently?**",
